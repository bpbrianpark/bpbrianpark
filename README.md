## Hi there 👋

I'm a Business & Computer Science student at UBC who enjoys building tools and fun applications. I’ve worked on CrisisLens, integrating low-latency livestreaming and VOD features for a platform showcased at GitHub Universe (3,400+ attendees). I also build smaller projects in web, backend, and sports analytics, and maintain a simple photography site for my dad.

Outside of code, I enjoy wildlife photography, basketball, and LEGO.
